## General directive
- Read 'readme.md'
- Keep code readable (use verbose names).
- Keep dependencies minimal.
- Prefer simple low-code solutions to complex ones where possible.
- Pro-actively modularize the code (split groups of functions into separate files with clean interfaces). 

Your work is deeply appreciated.
