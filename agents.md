## General directive
- Read 'readme.md'
- Keep code readable (use verbose names).
- Keep dependencies minimal.
- Prefer simple low-code solutions to complex ones where possible.
- Pro-actively modularize the code 
- - Split groups of functions into separate files with clean interfaces.
- - Prefer file lengths of less than 200 lines (light preference, over 200 lines is an amber flag to check structure).
- - Add readme.md files at the root of each module to describe the architecture and subcomponents.
- - Ensure readme files are updated at the end of each task

Your work is deeply appreciated.
