# Source modules

Core runtime code for BarnLights Playbox:

- `render-scene.mjs` – shared scene rendering and post-processing helpers.
- `engine.mjs` – side‑effect‑free render loop exposing `params` (including `renderMode`); call `start()` to emit SLICES_NDJSON.
- `server.mjs` – HTTP/WebSocket server serving the UI and applying param updates.
- `config-store.mjs` – read/write helpers for saving and loading effect presets.
- `effects/` – effect implementations, registry and post-processing helpers.
- `ui/` – browser UI for preview and controls, can modify the `params` which the engine renders.
- `ui/presets.mjs` – helper to fetch preset names and update the UI dropdown.

## A note on the engine's use of effects

Effects are plugins that declare their own controls and are selected via `params.effect`.
Their values live in `params.effects[effectId]`.
Post-processing modifiers run afterwards via a pipeline defined in `effects/post.mjs`.
Additional modifiers can be registered using `registerPostModifier` to extend the pipeline.
